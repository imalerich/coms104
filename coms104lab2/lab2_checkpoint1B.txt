***** Case 1 *****
Hello World
# prints out exactly the string we asked

***** Case 2 *****
Hello World
# the ',' let's us print out more than one thing per line, and adds spaces to separate these items

***** Case 3 *****
HelloWorld
# concatenates the strings "Hello" and "World" into one string by gluing them together
# as "HelloWorld", does not insert any additional characters (e.g. spaces)
# thus "HelloWorld" is printed

***** Case 4 *****
Hello
World
# The print command prints exactly one line (unless ',' is used)
# thus as we use separate print statements, we get separate lines

***** Case 5 *****
Hello World
# The ',' character here indicates that we want to print more stuff on the same line
# so even though we have more than one print statement, we still only get one line
